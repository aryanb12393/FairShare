# FairShare

FairShare is an app designed to solve the age-old problem of splitting bills fairly when dining out with friends. The app ensures that everyone pays their fair share, not just an equal share, making group dining experiences more equitable.

## Description

When dining out with friends, it's common to split the bill equally, but this isn't always fair if some people eat significantly less. FairShare addresses this by allowing users to accurately itemize what was consumed and 'who ate what', ensuring the bill is divided equitably.

### How It Works

1. **Add Users:** Start by adding the number of people in your group.
2. **Enter Items:** Input the items consumed and their corresponding prices.
3. **Tag Participants:** Assign who ate what.
4. **Calculate Shares:** FairShare will then calculate each person's fair share based on what they consumed.

## Usage

Currently, FairShare is still in production and can only be run on Xcode. You can use the generated Preview to input all necessary information and calculate the costs.

To run the project:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in Xcode.
3. Use the Xcode Preview feature to simulate the app and calculate individual costs.

## Future Plans

Before launching on the App Store, there are several improvements planned:

- **Error Validation:** Enhance input validation to ensure a smooth user experience.
- **OCR Integration:** Implement Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to allow users to take a photo of their receipt. The app will automatically read and input the data, which the user can then validate.
